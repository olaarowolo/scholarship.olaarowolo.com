1. Full Scholarship Overview Document

A complete explanation of the programme, its purpose, and the progression pathway.

Ola Arowolo Scholarship Programme

Supporting committed students from Iba Town, Ojo, Lagos, from JAMB to graduation

The scholarship was established to remove financial barriers, guide students through critical academic transitions, and reward excellence at university level. The programme follows a structured pathway that begins with JAMB support and progresses to tiered university funding based on performance.

How the Programme Works
Stage 1: JAMB Access and Preparation

All applicants begin at the JAMB stage. Support includes:
• Free JAMB Form for UTME candidates
• Guidance during the registration process
• Advice on subject combinations and exam preparation
• Follow up until the candidate sits for the exam
• Progression to the next stage only if the candidate passes

This ensures the scholarship begins with clear academic readiness.

Stage 2: Admission Support Phase

Candidates who successfully pass JAMB receive structured guidance to secure university admission. Support includes:
• Assistance with admission choices and course selection
• Advisory support for JAMB CAPS monitoring
• Verification of admission status
• Documentation review to confirm authenticity

Beneficiaries enter the funding phase only after admission is confirmed.

Stage 3: N100,000 Admission Scholarship

Once admitted into a recognised Nigerian university, each beneficiary receives a N100,000 scholarship, applied towards school fees.

How the amount may be used:
• If school fees are less than N100,000, the beneficiary may claim the balance later to support academic needs.
• If school fees are more than N100,000, the entire N100,000 is paid towards their fees upon receipt of evidence.
• Funds are paid directly to the institution or through verified channels.

This provides immediate relief at the point of entry into university.

Stage 4: Performance Based University Funding

The scholarship rewards academic excellence beyond the admission stage. Beneficiaries may qualify for additional financial support based on their university results.

A. Full Funding (100 percent of school fees)

A beneficiary becomes eligible for full funding when:
• Their first-year results show a first-class performance, and
• They maintain a first-class standard in subsequent years
• All results are submitted promptly each session

Full funding is renewed annually upon meeting all criteria.

B. Partial Funding (Up to 50 percent of school fees)

Beneficiaries who maintain strong academic performance may receive partial funding each year. Requirements include:
• CGPA of 4.0 or higher

• Good conduct and academic integrity

Partial funding covers up to half of their annual fees, based on the available scholarship allocation.
